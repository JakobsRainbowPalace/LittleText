# LittleText
A small texteditor written in Java by Jakob Rieke

This is just a little project of mine for getting started with the JavaFx Gui.

Requirements:
- the newest! JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your pc.
- knowledge how to use a command prompt

Installation: 
- open your command prompt and go into the folder where the sourccode lays. 
- enter: javac LittleText.java 
- wait until it finished building (compiling) the code
- enter: java LittleText
- wait a moment and the program will open. :)

Alright, thats it stay awesome! <3
Your J.R.
