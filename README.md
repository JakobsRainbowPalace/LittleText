# LittleText
A small texteditor written in Java by Jakob Rieke

This is just a little project of mine for getting started with the JavaFx Gui.

Requirements:
- the newest! JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your pc.
- knowledge how to use a command prompt

Installation: 
Then open your command prompt and go into the folder where the sourccode lays. 
Enter: javac LittleText.java 
wait until it's finished and then
enter: java LittleText
Wait a moment and the program will open. :)

Alright, thats it stay awesome! <3
Your J.R.
